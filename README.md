# Libft
## The very first project from the 42 programming school.

In this project we recoded some of the main functions of the C standard  library (libc).

42 students must follow **"The Norm"**, that can be checked here:

Apart from the libc functions, we are asked to code some "extra functions", that needs us to use a little bit more of our brains.

The bonus part is focused on linked lists, a new concept for us at 42 (because we already recoded some of the libc functions during the basecamp.
